            If you knew my history word for word <br>
            Had all of my history <br>
            Would you still love someone like me? <br>

            Baby, you don't have to be a star <br>
            But you're my Sun just the way you are <br>
            Just give me true love and understanding <br>
            And you'll keep my world bright

           Light on the streets, everytime <br>
           I say goodbye to you <br>
           Love on the streets, <br>
           Everytime I spend the day with youI wonder to myself <br>
           Could life ever be dark again?

            I can tell It's love that is going on <br>
            Hours seems to dissapear<br>
            When the sun is leaving,<br>
            You say goodbye to me
        </p>

            You gave me love when I wasn't believing in it <br>
            Cause you are, you are the reason why I can see through the darkness <br>
            And if there's something in the way, just give me your hand<br>
            Let's walk in the rays of a beautiful golden sun, however you'll be my brightness<br>
            When comes the night, the sun goes <br>
            But not You, you show'd me that really<br>
            There's a light that never goes out<br>
            Even after the goodbye, you bring light to the whole town <br>

            And for all the thanks you said, <br>
            I'll decline and say that the pleasure and privilege is mine. <br>
            <strong>There is a light and It never goes out...</strong>
